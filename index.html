        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
        himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
        armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
        brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
